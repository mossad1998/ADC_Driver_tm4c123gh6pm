# ADC_Driver_tm4c123gh6pm
This Driver enables you to initialize ADC Peripherals and use them in a simple way to help accelerate the design cycle.  
to read adc value from Potentiometer you need to connect 3 wires  
1. First terminal of Potentiometer to GND  
2. Third terminal of Potentiometer to 3.3 volt  
3. Second Terminal(Middle one) to E3
